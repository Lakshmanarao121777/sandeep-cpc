## 1.5.0: Overview
### Changes
- Updated application.yml to fix the non-externalization of the vault login path.  The path is now resolved from the deployment manifest like everything else.
- Amended the documentation to add the vault login path to the deployment manifest examples and description table.
- Lots of documentation spelling corrections.
- Updated build.gradle:
  - Updated jfrog plugin to latest version
  - Moved some plugins to the gradle Plugins DSL mode of loading
  - Ditched spring BOM dependency management since it makes the world a worse place just for existing.
  - Added hard version numbers to the spring dependencies.  Deterministic builds are nice.
  - Updated testCompile entries per the latest build template.
  - removed all the publishing sections. They are only for libraries - this is a service.
