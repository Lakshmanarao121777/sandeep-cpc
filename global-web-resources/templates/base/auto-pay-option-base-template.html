        <div class="card-title">Terms and Conditions for Automatic Payments (“Terms and Conditions”)</div>
        <div>
            <p>1. By accepting these Terms and Conditions you (i) agree that you are accepting these Terms and Conditions on behalf your company and/or the company you are employed by (the “Subscribing Company”), (ii) represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the Subscribing Company with the authority to bind the Subscribing Company and (iii) agree to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Subscribing Company. "You" and “Your” in these Terms and Conditions refers to (A) the Subscribing Company, (ii) you, an individual user, and (iii) any other Subscribing Company personnel accessing and using the Comcast website on the Subscribing Company’s behalf. </p>
            <p>2. These Terms and Conditions constitute a legal agreement between You and Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Comcast"). These terms and conditions are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other agreements between You and Comcast. </p>
            <p>3. You acknowledge and agree that You have elected to pay Your monthly Comcast Business statement through automatically recurring electronic fund transfers ("EFTs"). </p>
            <p>4. By enrolling in this recurring payment program, You authorize Comcast to (i) initiate automated clearing house (ACH) debit entries or debit card payments from the checking or savings account You specify, (ii) charge the specified credit card or (iii) credit the specified bank account, credit card and/or debit card in the appropriate amount for any refunds or other billing adjustments. The amount debited from Your checking or savings account or charged to Your credit card every month will be the then current balance on Your account. Your current balance is the amount on Your Comcast statement, plus additional charges billed to Your account after Your statement was issued, less credits or payments posted to Your account after Your statement was issued. Once Your enrollment is processed, all payments will be automatically withdrawn from Your specified checking or savings account or charged to the designated credit or debit card on the Comcast statement due date, unless you terminate Your authorization in the manner described herein. If You select a debit card as the payment source, Comcast may process the payment(s) over the primary network brand indicated on such debit card or any other network, including, but not limited to, the STAR, Pulse, NYCE or ACCEL networks.  </p>
            <p>5. You agree to be bound by any rules Your financial institution requires for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers and/or that Your debit or credit card issuer requires for pre-authorized debit or credit card transactions. You are responsible for all fees charged by Your financial institution associated with the pre-authorized payment option. </p>
            <p>6. You have the right to revoke Your authorization to Comcast for automatically recurring EFTs at any time. To revoke Your automatically recurring EFTs, (i) contact Comcast Business Customer Service (1-800-391-3000) and a customer service representative can make the change for Your business or (ii) visit businessclass.comcast.net (or any successor URL) (the “Website”), successfully sign in to Your account, navigate to where you may manage statement and payment preferences, follow the instructions provided, and save Your changes. Comcast automatic recurring EFTs will not take effect until 30-45 business days after receipt by Comcast of Your account information. </p>
            <p>7. You must update all changes to Your credit card or debit card information, or to the bank account information, from which EFTs are made, by accessing Your account through the Website. If you do not update Your checking/savings account or credit/debit card information and Comcast is unable to charge Your credit card or withdraw funds from Your debit card, checking account, or savings account, for the amount due on Your Comcast account, You may be subject to applicable late fees, returned item charges and any fees or charges assessed by Your financial institution. </p>
            <p>8. Comcast will make Your monthly statement available to you through the Website, which can be viewed by logging into Your account. The amount shown as due on Your business’ monthly statement will constitute notice to You of any variance in amount from the payment amount paid in the previous month by EFT. The balance shown as due on Your monthly statement will be charged to Your credit card or debit card or deducted from Your business’ bank account on the payment due date. You agree to review each statement you receive and give Comcast notice of any errors or disputed charges in writing and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement between You and Comcast.</p>
            <p>9. In order to ensure that Comcast is able to provide You with important notices and other information, You must update us with any change in Your contact information, including Your email address. To update the email address on Your account, please visit the Website. After You successfully sign in, please navigate to where You may change Your email address, follow the instructions provided, and save Your changes. </p>
            <p>10. COMCAST SHALL BEAR NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES OF ANY KIND THAT YOU MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF A PAYMENT MADE ON ITEMS INCORRECTLY BILLED, ANY DELAY IN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH YOUR ACCOUNT IS DEBITED OR YOUR CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED, OR YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND/OR VALID PAYMENT INFORMATION. </p>
            <p>11. Comcast reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time without actual notice. Notice of any such change may be given on or with Your statement or by other methods, including, but not limited to, email. </p>
            <p>12. These Terms and Conditions do not in any way terminate, amend or modify other terms, agreements or policies that apply to Your Comcast account or any Comcast services You receive or other agreements You may have with Comcast. </p>
